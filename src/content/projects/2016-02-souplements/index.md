An extension for the now defunct soup.io tumblelog. Towards the end of its life, the website was
barely maintained and fell apart in some places. So I started adding functionality using
bookmarklets and user scripts.

Among these were:
- Showing some page elements that the website allowed to hide
- Detecting and working around broken asset servers
- Quickly clearing your entire ignore list (There was a spam problem, so it frequently got filled
  by accounts that were already gone)
- A replacement for the websites native NSFW system, that allowed selectively reshowing the
  filtered posts and reduced loading times by actually taking these posts out of the DOM when hidden
- Fix old youtube/vimeo/dailymotion flash embeds and replacing them with modern embeds
