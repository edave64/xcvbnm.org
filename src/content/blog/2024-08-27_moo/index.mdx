Don't worry, you didn't miss anything. You're not expected to know what it is, I made it up myself.
It was born at a time I was still in love with dynamic programming languages in middle school. It
started when I got really into javascript and originally just combined it with a more ruby like
syntax. But I never really got past a few documents with ideas of how you could program something
in it.

Because of this very fluid non-design, it kept evolving in my head over the years. And while it's
original ideas stuck, they grew into something that monstrous. And now it's more of a running gag
inside my mind. But still kind of intriguing.

I actually tried writing down a documentation for it and even implement it
[on github](https://github.com/edave64/MooLang), but that's already outdated at this point. It
still has currying, before I noticed that that's not a great idea in a dynamically typed language,
especially if I wanted variadic functions.

I will write some examples of the language here. Most stuff should be pretty self explanatory.
Just know that `cio.out` is a `print` equivalent, assignment is done with `:`, function calls have
parentheses, around them like in Lisp, but they can be omitted at the top level.

# How it started

MooLang stands for Minimal Object Oriented Language. This originally came from the prototype based
object orientation I took from JS and Lua. I always liked the concept.

Objects are just key-value pairs. If the key isn't in the object, check its prototype. Recursively.
Essentially, that's it. No classes, interfaces, visibility, abstract, constructors, statics,
nothing. This simplicity really appealed to me.

# Scopes are objects

This was the most influencial idea I added to the language later, and somewhat marked the beginning
of the end. The point where the language stopped being a serious idea and became more of a toy.

If you think about it, variable scopes are objects. You have your fancy keywords like `var` that
set new keys in the scope object. If you are using a key that's not in your scope, it checks the
one scope above it. Recursively. That's just... a prototype chain. Scopes are objects in a
prototype chain.

So this epiphany being had, what if we make it a rule that accessing `.self` on every object
returns the object itself? Suddenly, you can do things like this:

```moo
self.foo: "Suddenly, a new variable!"
cio.out foo
```

We set a key on the scope object, and a new variable just appeared. This has some curious
consequences. Suddenly, you can pass your current scope to a different function. And using
something like javascripts `Object.getPrototypeOf`, you can directly manipulate scopes above your
own.

```moo
if true
    foo: "This variable will not be visible outside of this scope!"
    Object.getPrototypeOf(self).foo2: "This variable will be visible outside of this scope!"
end

cio.out foo2
```

I hope you are screaming already. As far as I know, this is fairly unheard of. For good reason.
It makes tracking down where a variable comes from suddenly into a challenge. This was the point
I knew I had made something weird. And making it weirder was no longer considered undesirable.

# Open closures

In languages that support closures, functions remember the scope they were defined in. And clearly,
this now means they remember their scope object in MooLang. And since we already have established
how scope objects can be used directly... we might as well make the closure scope of a function a
public property of the function object itself. (Functions are defined with `do` and `end`)

In the following example, the variable `val` would be hidden outside of the function in other
languages:

```moo
counter: do
    val: 0

    return do
        val: val + 1
        return val
    end
end

next = (counter)

cio.out (next) # 1
cio.out (next) # 2
```

But in MooLang, we can just:

```moo
next.closure.val: 50

cio.out (next) # 51
cio.out (next.closure.val) # 51
```

This is horrible. If you haven't noticed what we have just unleashed: Everything is now state.
Everything is mutable. Every value of the program is accessable from anywhere. Almost everything.

# Just take the stack while we are at it

Something that cannot yet be accessed is variables of the functions that called you. Inside a
function, the callers variables are not accessable. A grave injustice that must be corrected.

JavaScript to the rescue. It used to have a
[`caller`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/caller)
feature. Every function knew the last function that called it. That was terrible, and not quite
what we want. It doesn't work recursively.

So we introduce a new variable: `caller`. Any time you call a function, its stack object gets a
`caller` read-only property, that contains the stack object at the point where the function was
called.

Now, you can write a program that walks through the entire state of the program and e.g. increments
every number.

# Object/scope literal

So since objects and scopes are the same, they can be created the same way.

```moo
propFromParent: "This is a property from the parent scope"

obj: {
    foo: "bar"

    # You can reference already declared properties. Because they are just variables
    duplicate: foo

    # You can use code here. There is no special syntax
    4 + 4

    # We can access the parent scope
    prop: propFromParent

    printFoo: do
        cio.out foo
    end
}
```

If you just need a temporary scope, wrap the code in curly braces. If you need an object, do the
same, but capture the return value. It inherits the parent scope. Methods can access the properties
of the object, because it's their closure. And we didn't even need to do some hidden `this`
juggling like in JavaScript or `self` in Python. Or it would be, but in practice, we might still
need to implement that anyways. Otherwise the methods of the prototype don't actually 

The cons are of course that the declaring scope is now forever part of the object. We can access
`obj.propFromParent`, and that will work.

# Inheriting the objects you actually want

Having it so your objects can only inherit from their scope is fairly limiting. And while it would
would make programming an interesting challenge, that's not actually what I'm going for here.

As I see it, there are two ways to do this. One that's obvious, and one that doesn't introduce
anything new.

The obvious way would be to allow the prototype of an object to be set manually. Something like
this:

```moo
parent: {
    foo: "bar"

    Object.setPrototypeOf(self, null)
}

child: {
    printFoo: do
        cio.out foo
    end

    Object.setPrototypeOf(self, parent)
}
```

Of course, setting the prototype in the object itself isn't required, but I think it looks kinda
neat.

Having a separate function `Object.setPrototypeOf` is borrowed from JavaScript. Maybe it could also
just be a property `prototype` on the object. Which might look stranger and more prone to unwanted
injection, but it has more symmetry with the `closure` property of functions.

Speaking of, that would be the other way to do it.

```moo
parentCreator: do {
    foo: "bar"
} end

parentCreator.closure = null
parent = (parentCreator)

childCreator: do {
    printFoo: do
        cio.out foo
    end
} end

childCreator.closure = parent
```

Definitely less readable, but it requires no new concepts. For now, we'll just assume
`Object.setPrototypeOf` exists, but also that it wouldn't strictly have to.

But it leads us yet another interesting consequence.

# Build in sandboxing

Hidden state, is back. I didn't plan for this, it just happened. Like, in the previous chapter. If
you've somehow paid a lot of attention, you might have noticed it.

It's a bit backwards from how it usually works though. As far as I currently see, you can't stop
someone from the outside from accessing everything in your scope. But you can limit what you may
access yourself!

```moo
parent: {
    foo: "bar"

    Object.setPrototypeOf(self, null)

    # Access to an undefined variable, since it's not in the prototype chain of our scope anymore
    parent
}
```

This additionally has the effect that, in the previous code examples `printFoo` would actually
fail to execute, since `cio` isn't in scope anymore. So it would crash at that point.

So you'd probably never want the prototype to actually be null. Or at least before you set it,
you copy over everything from the parents scope you'll need.

# Unifying functions and objects

At this point, functions and objects are the primary concepts of the language left over. So perhaps
we can unify some more. So, are objects functions? Or are functions objects?

If we terribly simplify the concepts, both are mappings from one set of values to another.
Functions are obviously the more powerful mapping, since it supports more than one key. But objects
are more flexible. Or are they?

If you're familiar with languages like haskell, you might be familiar with code like this:

```haskell
fac 0 = 1
fac n = n * fac (n - 1)
```

So setting the `keys` of a function isn't unheard of. How about:

```moo
obj: do key
    prototype key
end

(obj "key") = "value"
```

So we can do inheritance with this. Our function just calls the prototype function if the key isn't
explicitly defined otherwise. This isn't actually that revolutionary. Ruby objects have a
[`method_missing`](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/BasicObject.html#method-i-method_missing), which
is called if a method is called on an object that isn't defined. And in lua, the metatable of an
object can define [`__index`](https://www.lua.org/pil/13.4.1.html), which is either another object
for normal prototype inheritance, or a function that decides the value.

Using a function as a base actually makes our inheritance even more powerful. You can have multiple
inheritance. Just look up the key in one prototype, and if it's not there, use lookup in a second
prototype.

# The actual takeaway

So what useful things actually came out of this? Well, conceptually not much. A lot of things this
language tries to do would be terribly inefficient, would programming probably more difficult than
help with it, and makes reasoning about your program much harder. In a way it's maybe more
insidious than something like brainfuck, because it looks more normal at a first glance.

Something I still really like is the base syntax. `:` for assignment instead of `=` makes a clearer
distinction between assigning and equality testing.

The lisp-like call syntax is still pretty I think. Allowing the top level expression of every line
to skip it gets rid of the parentheses-hell lisp often causes, allows ruby like calls without any
parentheses, and still makes it very clear where the calls are and what order they are in.

Also, something I skipped here, it has a syntax for short strings: `'like_this`, with just a single
quotation followed by a text that follows the same rule as identifiers, similar again to ruby's
symbol literals. It gives the single quotation something point other than "double quotes, but
single" or C's pointless character literal that still needs the closing quote, despite the fact
it's not allowed to be more than one letter. I've used this syntax in a few other projects.
