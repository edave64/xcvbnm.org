Originally, the topic of this month was "Retro reverse engineering". I wanted to learn something
about how the Generation 1 Pokémon games work. The plan changed halfway through and I ended up
making a rom hack for Pokémon Red/Blue that aims to fix some of it's glitches.

# An emulator for debugging

I didn't expect this part to be difficult. There are a lot of gameboy emulators out there, and I
just expected them to have good debuggers.

That wasn't really the case. It doesn't help that I'm stuck on macOS on my main PC.

The first result I found was [BGB](https://bgb.bircd.org). It has a pretty good debugger, but it's
windows only (It's supposed to run under wine, I didn't try that). But it's still what I used for
the first few days on my windows laptop. Strangely when using it over remote desktop, the graphics
can't be seen. And when using AnyDesk, the graphics work, but the arrow keys don't. So I had to
switch computers for this.

Later on, I found [Emulicious](https://emulicious.net). It's got an even better debugger, VS Code
integration, and is written in java, so it's cross platform.

# Actual reverse engineering

## Custom dialog

First, I tried to actually understand the assembly code of the Pokémon games. Using tools like tile
map visualization and ram watches, I found out how the dialog system in Pokémon Red works, at least
graphically.

The gameboy has two tilemaps. Let's call them A and B. The actual overworld always seems to be on
map A. When the player initiates a dialog, all tiles at the current location are copied over to
map B, and the dialog put on top.

I assume this is done so the game can just seamlessly return to gameplay after a dialog without
having to clean up the textbox tiles and reload the part of the map that the textbox covered.

Strangely any changes manual changes to tilemap B got immediatly reversed. It appeared that the
dialog tilemap is copied over every frame from another memory location "C490".

Writing the text I want into that location, I was able to manipulate the dialog that is currently
displayed.

Interestingly, from what I've seen, both maps are actually always active. The gameboy has a
"window", that can be used to display a section of another map at a given X Y offset. This is
typically used to display HUDs in games.

Pokémon instead uses it to display the tilemap B with the dialog above the tilemap A. Manually
moving the window shows the actual map still underneath it, making parts of the screen look
doubled.

With it, the room appears duplicated. His two desks are drawn using the background layer, then the window layer starts and draws the whole left side of the room again. The sprites are still in their correct places, since they are not affected by tile scrolling](./window_moved.png)

## Cheating

import Cheating from './cheating.mp4';

Since a debugger gives us a lot of power, and power corrupts, I tried to cheat at the game next.

Using a memory search, I managed to find the memory location that contains the HP of the players
pokémon. This process was similar to using cheat engine. You enter the value the HP currently
should have, and the search finds every ram address with a matching value. Then you either heal
or take damage, changing the HP value and search again in the remaining values. This pretty
quickly brings you to one or two variables that could be responsible.

By freezing this ram value, I was able to make my pokémon mostly invulnerable. But there were
some strange effects because the value was still changed, it just immediatly reset.

Then, I used a memory watchpoint to stop code execution when the HP value gets written to. Using
that, I found the code that applies the damage. Replacing the "SUB" in that function with a "NOP"
I could stop all damage from hitting my pokémon.

## Decompilation
import './screenshot_inverter.css'

I know that pokémon wasn't programmed in C, but I wanted to see if Ghidra would be able to give me
some insight into what's happening in the code.

I wanted to inject some custom text directly into the rom, so I tried to understand the routine
that reads text from rom. I managed to "decompile" two functions that are responsible for
displaying the borders of the textbox.

# Switching things up

At this point, I decided I wasn't making the kinds of progress I wanted. With my monthly projects,
I wanted to have something I could release every day. More importantly, I didn't feel comfortable
enough actually reading assembly to make any significant progress.

So I wanted to try something easier and work with the existing
[pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered) disassembly. That way I could get more used to working
with assembly without jumping in on the deep end.
