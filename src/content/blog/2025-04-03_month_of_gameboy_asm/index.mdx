Originally, the topic of this month was "Retro reverse engineering". I wanted to learn something
about how the Generation 1 Pokémon games work. The plan changed halfway through and I ended up
making a rom hack for Pokémon Red/Blue that aims to fix some of it's glitches.

# An emulator for debugging

I didn't expect this part to be difficult. There are a lot of gameboy emulators out there, and I
just expected them to have good debuggers.

That wasn't really the case. It doesn't help that I'm stuck on macOS on my main PC.

The first result I found was [BGB](https://bgb.bircd.org). It has a pretty good debugger, but it's
windows only (It's supposed to run under wine, I didn't try that). But it's still what I used for
the first few days on my windows laptop. Strangely when using it over remote desktop, the graphics
can't be seen. And when using AnyDesk, the graphics work, but the arrow keys don't. So I had to
switch computers for this.

Later on, I found [Emulicious](https://emulicious.net). It's got an even better debugger, VS Code
integration, and is written in java, so it's cross platform.
