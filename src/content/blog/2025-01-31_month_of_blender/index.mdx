This year, I wanted to try something new. Actually, a lot of things new. A have a massive backlog of projects I have hardly ever touched and things I've always wanted to learn.

So to address this, for each month of this year I want to pick one thing that I will do. That will be the one thing I work on. Each day, I want to make a post about what I did
that day over on mastodon, and I guess today I've spontainiously decided to also write blog posts about it at the end of the month. Also, I have to release everything I do at
least daily. This is to force me to produce constantly produce something and not get stuck trying to get things exactly right.

As you know from the title, this month I tried to learn blender. That's a big program, but since I only have a month, I'm not planing on becoming an expert anyways. Just get
familiar enough with it to make *something*. 

Conincidentally, when I made an announcement post about this, someone made me aware of the
["Blenduary"](https://blenderartists.org/t/new-january-daily-art-challenge-blenduary/1560953) art challange, a list of prompts for january to make one image per day.
So this month basically ended up as: Do the [Donut tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0J27sf9N1Y&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z), then make blenduary images.
For some of them I followed some other tutorials on youtube, but later on most were just made by hand with some use of guides for specific node setups.

All .blend files, assets, etc. I've produced for this are released under CC0 on github: https://github.com/edave64/2025-01-month-of-blender/tree/main/

## The donut

I really liked the tutorial. It gave me a good overview over all of the different parts blender offers, and there wasn't anything in there that I didn't keep on using for the
rest of blenduary. My only issue was that he was promoting his own asset library, which was incompatible with the CC0 licence I chose for the project. Instead, I used assets
from https://www.thebasemesh.com and https://www.blenderboom.com/, with textures from https://cc0-textures.com/.

### Final render

## Blenduary Results

### Day 01: Ripple

import Ripple from './01-ripple.png';

<Image src={Ripple} alt="A render of a rough sphere. It is made up of hundreds of randomly rotated cylinders." />

This image happened as a bit of an accident while working on the donut tutorial. It happened while I was trying to create the plate asset. I created a new cylinder, but
added it to the collection used for donut sprinkles, packing hundreds of 1 meter large cylinders around the donut, turning it practically into a sphere.

### Day 02: Crystals

import Crystal from './02-crystals.png';
import CrystalRedo from './02-crystals-redo.png';

<Image src={Crystal} alt="A render of a cave like thing with blue, glowing crystals. There is a green light coming from around a bend." />

The idea here was to create a cave with glowing crystals, with a mysterious green glow around the corner.

This was the first time working with emmissive textures. Using them naively destroyed all detail in the crystals, since it's hard to have a shadow on a glowing surface.
So they didn't look like actual objects.

The cave didn't look great either, since it's essentially just a donut from the inside.

<Image src={CrystalRedo} alt="A render of a cave like thing with blue, glowing crystals. There is a green light coming from around a bend." />

I later created this improved version. The cave still doesn't look fantastic, but the crystals look a lot more like physical objects and the lower emmissive strength
makes the cave look a bit less smooth.

### Day 03: Workbench

import Workbench from './03-workbench.png';
import WorkbenchRedo from './03-workbench-redo.png';

<Image src={Workbench} alt="A wooden table with a big block of wood being chisled. There are wood shavings on the table. One side is completely black" />

My first attempt at modeling objects, destroyed by a problem with the texture. I still don't know why, but applying the normal map makes one side pitch black.

<Image src={WorkbenchRedo} alt="A wooden table with a big block of wood being chisled. There are wood shavings on the table." />

After I replaced the normal map with a bump map, it's still not pretty, but better.

### Day 04: Spider

import Spider from './04-spider.png';

<Image src={Spider} alt="A render of a black, hairy spider" />

My first attempt at modeling a living creature. I tried to make something similar to a jumping spider, to make it at least a little cute, so I wouldn't hate to look at it.
Not really a spider fan. ^^'

### Day 05: Celeste

import Celeste from './05-celeste.png';

<Image src={Celeste} alt="A blue, low-poly mountain with an orange sky and heavy fog." />

I wasn't sure what to do with this prompt, so I made something vaguely inspired by the logo of the game celeste.

### Day 06: Tesslate

import Tesslate from './06-tesslate.png';

<Image src={Tesslate} alt="A house made of large, irregularly shaped, gray pieces of stone. It has red roof tiles." />

I watched some YT tutorials about making brick textures with displacement, and did a similar thing with voronoi textures. The roofing tiles are (suboptimally) generated are
with geometry nodes, which means the base mash of this scene is actually just 7 completely flat faces.

### Day 07: Portal

import Portal from './07-portal.mp4'; 

<video controls src={Portal} style="max-width: 100%;" alt="A camera ride through a triangular room with three doors. Every door loops back to the same position. You can see multiple iterations of the same room through the doors." loop />

In recent history, Blender added a "Ray Portal BSDF" node, allowing rays that enter to be moved somewhere else. This allows for some fantastic effects, but at least from what I
saw, the ergonomics are terrible. It can do a lot. It can keep a static angle, to be used as a flat image that's rendered from somewhere else, like a TV, or a dynamic angle for
a portal like effect, it can scale up and down or rotate, or use multiple target locations on one texture, it's pretty neat.

The problem is that this means the node leaves all the math burden to you, and the documentation did not help me much. The
[documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/shader/ray_portal.html) gives you a sample node setup with nodes for "Location of Portal Target" and
"Rotation of Portal Target", but those are lies. Changing the location changes rotation and rotation, and rotation is a static value that seems very unrelated to the actual
rotation of the portal.

I made this animation through pure trial and error.

### Day 08: Orrery

import Orrery from './08-orrery.mp4'; 

<video controls src={Orrery} style="max-width: 100%;" alt="An animation of a camera flying around an orrery with a sun, 3 planets and 5 moons orbiting around each other." />

My first attempt at a more complex chorreography. It features keyframe animation outside of just location, rotation and scale, and a hand-off between two cameras. It was also the
first time I tried working with the eevee render, simply because I didn't have time to render it otherwise. It's surprisingly picky.

### Day 09: Aurora

import Aurora from './09-aurora.mp4';
import AuroraJoke from './09-aurora-joke.png';

<video controls src={Aurora} style="max-width: 100%;" alt="A snowy landscape under a dark blue night sky with an aurora borealis and some clouds/fog." />

Made mostly by following a tutorial, but I also learned how to make a more complex animated sky texture.

The effect doesn't look bad in itself, I think it's mostly the positioning of the lines in the sky (and the unconvincing snow) that I'd like to revisit, but for now, I'll leave it
as is, and hide it by keeping it entirely localized within my kitchen.

<Image src={AuroraJoke} alt="A door that is ajar with a strong orange glow behind it, modeled after the 'Steamed Hams' scene in the Simpsons" />

(Yes, this is part of this days submission)

### Day 10: Diffuse

import Diffuse from './10-diffuse-redo.png';

<Image src={Diffuse} alt="A cat viewed through a pair of glasses. Everything outside the glasses is clear, everything though the glasses is blurry." />

NOTE: The cat is just a jpeg, I did not suddenly graduated to photorealistic cats.

This was definitly more of a case of wanting to learn something and fitting it to the theme. I used this to learn both to use curves for modeling and using cryptomasks in the
compositor. Also, this is the fixed version. Originally, I rendered it with far to little light for some reason and didn't notice at the time.
